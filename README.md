Ewing's Quantitative Population Ethology

To install, first do

```
> install.packages("devtools")
```

If on Windows, you will then need to install Rtools from <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools>.
This is an executable that will install some applications in c:\Rtools. 
You will also need pdflatex, which means you need a TeX distribution such as MikTeX or TeX Live.

```
> library(devtools)

> install_github("byandell/ewing")
```

Alternatively, you can visit <http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell/ewing>
