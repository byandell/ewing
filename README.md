Ewing's Quantitative Population Ethology

To install, first do

```
> install.packages("devtools")
```

If on Windows, you will then need to install Rtools from <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools>.
This is an executable that will install some applications in c:\Rtools. 
You will also need pdflatex, which means you need a TeX distribution such as MikTeX or TeX Live.

```
> library(devtools)

> install_github("byandell/ewing")
```

Alternatively, you can visit <http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell/ewing>

### Code Issues

- gencurve in spline.R internal to five.plot but used elsewise
- dead used in init, event
- organsim.features in community.R using mydata() nonstandard
- TemperatureBase in init.R community.R/initTemp
- to.plot in triangle.R plot.current not defined
- hour, knotrange undefined in temp.R
- lo.hour, hi.hour etc in temp.plot?
- File ‘ewing/R/init.R’: assign(toto, get(from), ".GlobalEnv")
- somehow crawler count ends up being negative, which throws off plot (future.events) [FIXED]
- looks like end of event.R/get.birth has hanging `get.future`

## Code layout

The `init.simulation` and `future.events` are the high level routines to initialize and run a simulation. They draw on default settings pulled from global datafiles.
Plan is to make this more adaptable, of course.

#### future.R

##### future.events

Realize future events in quantitative population ethology simulation
 
This is the main routine for Ewing's Quantitative Population Ethology. It
steps through future events for individuals starting with the next minimum
future event time.
Steps through future events for community with one or more species. Keeps
track of counts by age classes and substrates in external file.

The routine `future.events` builds the name of the event processor
function based on event type, which is established in the `future.host`
or `future.parasite` data structure. The `event.attack` uses
further information from `organism.features` about the type of parasite
(`endo` or `ecto`) in conjunction with the current event
(`feed` or `ovip`) to determine the nature of attack.
 
A plot is created periodically unless `plotit=FALSE`.  An external
`file` is written with simulation counts for re-plotting.

future.events( community ) 

- species = community.R/get.species( community )
- community = community.R/initCount( community, species, file, append )
- community = community.R/init.timing( community )
- mintime = community.R/getCount( community, , "mintime" )

- community = sim.R/updateCount( community, species.now, individual, stage == "death", istep )
- community = community.R/put.individual( community, species.now, individual )
- community = future.R/event.death( community, species.now )
- community = event.R/event.parsed( community, species.now )
- community = event.future( community, species.now )
- community = set.timing( community, event.type, 1 )
- init.R/getOrgAlive( community, species.now )
- community = setEvents( community, "final" )
- community = fini.timing( community )

##### event.future

Process immediate, pending and future events in quantitative population
ethology simulation.
 
Process an event for next individual in a species. Events may be monadic
(one individual) or dyadic (involving two individuals).
These are the main event processors for Ewing's Quantitative Population
Ethology. They all take the same arguments, but handle events in quite
different ways.

- `event.future` is the generic routine for monadic
future events, such as progressing through life stages.
- `event.death`
handles all pending events of death of individuals.
- `event.birth` handles immediate events of new births. It assumes at
present one birth at a time, leading ultimately to a starved state.
The `future.host` data has the gravid adult returning to the fertile state
until it depletes its resources. The pending event "starved" then triggers
the pending event "death".
- `event.attack` is an example of a dyadic event processor, in this case
host-parasite interaction. The parasite locates a host based on life stages
and relative position in the simulation space. Ectoparasites kill their
hosts, hence realizing a pending death event (to be processed immediately by
`event.death` in the next step). Endoparasites merely incapacitate
their hosts.
 
At present, the search strategies of parasites and health consequences of
hosts are crude. However, search is over substrates and depends on the stage
of hosts. A crude sex determination strategy is in place, with smaller
(younger) hosts more likely to get male parasite eggs.
The external file `community.out` is written with simulation counts
following each event that changes the number or stage of individuals.

User-supplied `event.blah` functions can be specified in user-supplied
libraries. Note that user code needs to comply with the arguments and
values, and needs to process future events for individuals as they progress
through life. Further, user routines need to properly update counts to the
external file. This is at present an advanced topic, but can be figured out
by examining the above routines.

#### triangle.R

rtri()

# Plot routines

The primary summary plot is `plot.ewing`, or `ggplot_ewing`, in `plot.R`.
This gives a summary over the whole simulation.
However, other plot routines were created, some being interactive:

- spline.R/five.plot # interactive plot to design curve with spline and backspline
- spline.R/five.show # interactive plot (same thing or different?)
- temp.R/temp.plot # plot of day to degree-day to see effect of temp variation
- temp.R/temp.design # interactive plot to design hi and lo temp ranges
- triangle.R/plot_current # plot spatial positions of hosts and parasites
- triangle.R/text_current # text add (not sure if needed?)

# Data organization

The object `community` has element `pop` which has elements for the `species`.
For some reason, I set these up by row rather than column, and I think this trashes things like the substrate labels. Somehow in the `plot_ewing` this works OK, but in `plot_current` for position, it is lost. Seems this may take some work, and best to wait on that for now.
