To install, first do

> install.packages("devtools")

If on Windows, you will then need to install Rtools from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools.
This is an executable that will install some applications in c:\Rtools. 
You will also need pdflatex, which means you need a TeX distribution such as MikTeX or TeX Live.

> library(devtools)

> install_github("ewing", "byandell")
