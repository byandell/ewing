#' realize future events in quantitative population ethology simulation
#' 
#' Steps through future events for community with one or more species. Keeps
#' track of counts by age classes and substrates.
#' 
#' @details 
#' This is the main routine for Ewing's Quantitative Population Ethology. It
#' steps through future events for individuals starting with the next minimum
#' future event time.
#' 
#' All individuals have a `current` stage and are organized into an event queue,
#' which is a triply-linked leftist tree,
#' based on the scheduled time for their next `future` event.
#' Each species has its own leftist tree, with the tops of those trees
#' identifying the individuals with the closest (in time) next `future` event.
#' Internal routine `put.species`, in conjuction with
#' `leftist.update`, `leftist.remove` or `leftist.birth`, modify the leftist trees
#' when there is an individual event update, death (remove) or birth(s), respectfully.
#' 
#' An individual in a species will progress from `current` to `future` stage
#' when its event time is at the top of the event queue. The `fid` points to the row in
#' this table corresponding to the `future` stage, which would then become the `current` stage.
#' The code uses numeric `fid` because it ends up in a vector of other numeric values.
#' 
#' Note that sometimes there are multiple rows with the same `current` value, which are 
#' competing risks. For instance `future.host` has competing risks from the `current` stage
#' `second.3` of becoming `female` or `male`, while `future.parasite` has competing risk from
#' the current stage `adult` to `feed` or `ovip`osit, with return lines from `feed` and `ovip`
#' to `adult`. That is, an adult parasite might feed or oviposit, which have different health
#' and population consequences: feeding prolongs life while ovipositing produces new offspring
#' and depletes life.
#' 
#' The `time` entry is used to schedule the time of the `future` event. That is, when and
#' individual appears at the top of the event queue. 
#' 
#' 
#' A plot is created periodically unless \code{plotit=FALSE}.
#' If argument `file` is set to a file name, an external
#' file is written with simulation counts for re-plotting.

#' process immediate, pending and future events in quantitative population
#' ethology simulation
#' 
#' Process an event for next individual in a species. Events may be monadic
#' (one individual) or dyadic (involving two individuals).
#' 
#' These are the main event processors for Ewing's Quantitative Population
#' Ethology. They all take the same arguments, but handle events in quite
#' different ways. \code{event.future} is the generic routine for monadic
#' future events, such as progressing through life stages. \code{event.death}
#' handles all pending events of death of individuals.
#' 
#' \code{event.birth} handles immediate events of new births. It assumes at
#' present one birth at a time, leading ultimately to a starved state. The
#' \code{future.host} data has the gravid adult returning to the fertile state
#' until it depletes its resources. The pending event "starved" then triggers
#' the pending event "death".
#' 
#' \code{event.attack} is an example of a dyadic event processor, in this case
#' host-parasite interaction. The parasite locates a host based on life stages
#' and relative position in the simulation space. Ectoparasites kill their
#' hosts, hence realizing a pending death event (to be processed immediately by
#' \code{event.death} in the next step). Endoparasites merely incapacitate
#' their hosts.
#' 
#' At present, the search strategies of parasites and health consequences of
#' hosts are crude. However, search is over substrates and depends on the stage
#' of hosts. A crude sex determination strategy is in place, with smaller
#' (younger) hosts more likely to get male parasite eggs.
#' 
#' Simulation counts are stored internally unless the argument `file` is set
#' to the name of an external file.
#' Following each event, counts are recorded of changes to the number or stage of individuals.
#' 
#' The routine \code{future.events} builds the name of the event processor
#' function based on event type, which is established in the \code{future.host}
#' or \code{future.parasite} data structure. The \code{event.attack} uses
#' further information from \code{organism.features} about the type of parasite
#' (\code{endo} or \code{ecto}) in conjunction with the current event
#' (\code{feed} or \code{ovip}) to determine the nature of attack.
#' 
#' User-supplied \code{event.blah} functions can be specified in user-supplied
#' libraries. Note that user code needs to comply with the arguments and
#' values, and needs to process future events for individuals as they progress
#' through life. This is at present an advanced topic, but can be figured out
#' by examining the above routines.
