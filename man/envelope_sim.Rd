\title{Envelope for Ewing simulations}
\usage{
envelope_sim(nsim)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsim}{number of simulations to run}
}
\description{
This currently relies on integer `step` value, but ultimately want to use the `time`,
which are not the same across simulations. That will require using spline interpolation
to a common grid. More work.
