\title{future events table for species simulation}
\format{
Data frame with one row per stage, except in the case of competing
risks. Time is in appropriate units for species as set in
\code{organism.features}.
\describe{
 \item{current}{current stage}
 \item{future}{potential future event}
 \item{fid}{future event ID, corresponds to row when this is current stage}
 \item{time}{mean time to future event}
 \item{pch}{plot character}
 \item{color}{plot color}
 \item{ageclass}{class of stage (see \code{organism.features}}
 \item{event}{event class}
 \item{init}{current stage weighting for initialization}
}

\description{
Contains life history events for QPE simulation. These are normally
internalized via \code{init.simulation}.

\details{
This sets out how an individual in a species will progress from `current` to `future` stage
when its event time is at the top of the event leftist tree queue. The `fid` points to the row in
this table corresponding to the `future` stage, which would then become the `current` stage.
The code uses numeric `fid` because it ends up in a vector of other numeric values.

Note that sometimes there are multiple rows with the same `current` value, which are 
competing risks. For instance `future.host` has competing risks from the `current` stage
`second.3` of becoming `female` or `male`, while `future.parasite` has competing risk from
the current stage `adult` to `feed` or `ovip`osit, with return lines from `feed` and `ovip`
to `adult`. That is, an adult parasite might feed or oviposit, which have different health
and population consequences: feeding prolongs life while ovipositing produces new offspring
and depletes life.

The `time` entry is used to schedule the time of the `future` event. That is, when and
individual appears at the top of the event queue.
